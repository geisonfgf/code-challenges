Graphs

Problems:

Is Graph bipartite?
    DFS solution

Find Graph cycles?
    DFS solution

Find a (general) cycle that uses every edge exactly once:
    Eulerian tour solution (classic graph processing problem)

Find a cycle that visit every vertex exactly one, this problem is
commonly called (traveling sales person problem):
    Hamiltoniam cycle (classical NP-complete problem)

Are two Graphs identical except for vertex names?
    No solution so far

Lay out a Graph in the plane without crossing edges?
    Linear time DFS based planarity algorithm (Tarjan 1970s) - very complex
